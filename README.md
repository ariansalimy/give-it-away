# Give-It-Away
This is a simple tool to help promoters run giveaways developed using next-js. Everything is run locally for now, but I intend to move it to a public website
once the problem is finished. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Credits
Give-It-Away uses the following open-source projects:

- [https://ui.shadcn.com/](shadcn/ui): All UI Elements
- date-fns
