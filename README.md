# Give-It-Away
This is a simple web app to help promoters run giveaways developed using next-js.Everything is run locally for now, but I intend to move it to a public website
once the main application is finished. Give-It-Away is a work-in-progress and is not finished. There may be bugs and edge cases I have not accounted for. It is public so that people may see the work that I have done so far and provide feedback.

## Features
- File upload for giveaway entries
- Customizable giveaway elements (Date, # of tickets, Venue, Artist)
- Template message to use for notifying winners (based on what you input)
- Randomizer that provides winner

## TODOS
- Refine CSS/refactor elements to make visual appearance consistent
- Add more customizability
- Host on web server (This will require security improvements. Run this locally)
- Input field for giveaway names
- Integration (if possible) with Instagram API for messaging

## Getting Started

Run this locally.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
