      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <h4>We started with an idea for a fitness-tracking application. Our initial problem statement was: <br>
        “How might we create better features to track gym progress to help connect gym enthusiasts?”<br><br>
        
        Over the course of our design process, we narrowed our problem statement to:<br>
        “How might we improve fitness tracking and encourage gym-related goals?”<br><br>
        
        Which eventually became:
        “How might we improve fitness tracking and connect gym enthusiasts?”<br><br>
        
        And finally ended as:
        “How might we create a sense of community and help connect gym enthusiasts at their local gym?”<br><br>
        
        But how did we get there? It all happened over time.

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <h4>Our first step was a competitive analysis of the top fitness-tracking applications currently on the market.</h4>

        From this analysis, we found one key weak spot in all of these applications: A sense of community.<br><br>

    <h3>Interviews and Insights</h3>
    <h4>This led to the team conducting interviews with people who fit the category of fitness-oriented individuals who use something, whether it be an application or journal, to log their workout progress. From these interviews, we gained plenty of insight into what we needed to focus on for our application. Some key quotes that we used for our design process were:

        What we had all realized was that the "fitness tracker" solution was neither solving the core problem nor feasible. The real solution was giving users a way to find workout partners.
        We all created different ideas of what we thought was suitable for the problem at hand and came together to form a final low-fidelity prototype. 
        We moved onto a mid-fidelity prototype which consists of what we thought our application’s basic design and features would look like. 
        Finally, we took our mid-fidelity prototype and found everything we needed to keep or remove and created a high-fidelity prototype that consists of our final design and working interactive components made in Figma.</h4></h4>

      Design Evaluation
    </h3>
    <h4>
      To test our initial design ideas and prototype, we implemented a multi-step approach that involved both competitive analysis (documented earlier) and direct user feedback.

    </h4>
    </div>
  <div class="row mb-2">

    
    <h5>
     We conducted a design evaulation of our high-fidelity prototype with potential users who performed tasks and recorded their thoughts. We received some UI advice that lead to changes in simplifying our design making the application easier to use and more clear to the user, such as changing certain alert messages and adding more context to what the purpose of "adding a friend" means for our app. 
    </h5>
    <h5>
Peer reviews in our class also helped us with evaulating our design over time. We gained a better understanding of user needs, such as allowing users to find people at multiple gyms, and letting users display their "workout level" by showcasing how long a user had been a member of their gym for and the activities that they are involved in aside from working out. These insights were crucial to our mid and high-fidelity prototypes.

  <h3>
    Project Outcome
  </h3>
  <h4>
    The work I and my partners put into this project resulted in a functional prototype for an application to find a workout partner.
    
  </h4>
  <h5>
    I now have solid experience in the entire design process and have strengthened my understanding of HCI principles.
    Going forward, I am going to take the skills that I have gained and refined from working on SpotMe to improve this prototype and potentially translate it into a functioning iOS application.
    Or, I will conduct my own design project in order to really put my skills to the test!
